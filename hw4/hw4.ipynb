    "In this homework, we will use pandas to build a cohort of ICU stays and visualize the results from the MIMIC-IV dataset, which you did for Homework 3 in BIOSTAT 203B. \n",
    "\n",
    "For processing the Parquet files, one other option is [`polars`](https://pola.rs/). The package is designed for rapid analysis of data frames, possibly larger than memory, with pandas-like syntax, Apache Arrow-based data representation and the Rust language as its backend. Syntax is similar to what you have used for `pyarrow`. You are allowed to use any method you like for analyzing data, but use of `pyarrow`, `duckdb`, or `polars` is certainly recommended for larger files to save your memory and time. (_Hint_: If you want to try `polars`, look into `scan_parquet()` and `LazyFrame`. The package `polars` supports lazy evaluation similar to what you have seen in the R `arrow` package.)\n",
