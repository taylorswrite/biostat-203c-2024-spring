    "\n",
    "In this problem, we'll simulate the *simple random walk*, perhaps the most important discrete-time stochastic process. Random walks are commonly used to model phenomena in physics,  chemistry, biology, and finance. In the simple random walk, at each timestep we flip a fair coin. If heads, we move foward one step; if tails, we move backwards. Let \"forwards\" be represented by positive integers, and \"backwards\" be represented by negative integers. For example, if we are currently three steps backwards from the starting point, our position is `-3`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write `random_walk` to simulate a random walk. Your function should: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Take an upper and lower bound as inputs.\n",
    "- Return three variables `pos`, `positions`, `steps`, in that order.\n",
    "- `pos` is an integer, and indicates the walk's final position at termination.\n",
    "- `positions` is a list of integers, and it is a log of the position of the walk at each time step. Includes the initial position but excludes the final position.\n",
    "- `steps` is a list of integers, and it is a log of the results of the coin flips. Values of `-1`s and `1`s.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When the walk reaches the upper or lower bound, print a message such as `Upper bound at 3 reached` and terminate the walk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should include at least one instance of an `elif` statement and at least one instance of a `break` statement."
