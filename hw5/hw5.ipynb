    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "What's your favorite movie? Wouldn't it be nice to find more shows that you might like to watch, based on ones you know you like? Tools that address questions like this are often called \"recommender systems.\" Powerful, scalable recommender systems are behind many modern entertainment and streaming services, such as Netflix and Spotify. While most recommender systems these days involve machine learning, there are also ways to make recommendations that don't require such complex tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you'll use webscraping to answer the following question: \n",
    "\n",
    "> What movie or TV shows share actors with your favorite movie?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of this question is that, if the movie Y has many of the same actors as the movie X, and you like X, you might also enjoy Y. \n",
    "\n",
    "This homework has two parts. In the first, larger part, you'll write a webscraper for finding shared actors on TMDB. In the second, smaller part, you'll use the results from your scraper to make recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to meet the specifications for a complete list of what you need to do to obtain full credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1. Locate the Starting TMDB Page\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick your favorite movie, and locate its TMDB page by searching on [https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/). For example, my favorite movie is _Harry Potter and the ~~Sorcerer's~~Philosopher's Stone_.\n",
    "Its TMDB page is at:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/671-harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Save this URL for a moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. Dry-Run Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we're just going to practice clicking through the navigation steps that our scraper will take. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, click on the *Full Cast & Crew* link. This will take you to a page with URL of the form \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<original_url>cast/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, scroll until you see the *Cast* section. Click on the portrait of one of the actors. This will take you to a page with a different-looking URL. For example, the URL for Alan Rickman, who played Severus Snape, is \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.themoviedb.org/person/4566-alan-rickman\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, scroll down until you see the actor's *Acting* section. Note the titles of a few movies and TV shows in this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our scraper is going to replicate this process. Starting with your favorite movie, it's going to look at all the actors in that movie, and then log all the *other* movies or TV shows that they worked on. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it would be a good idea for you to use the Developer Tools on your browser to inspect individual HTML elements and look for patterns among the names you are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3. Create your module\n",
    "\n",
    "No template is provided for this homework. You will write your two functions in a separate file `hw5module.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4. Some hints\n",
    "\n",
    "You may run into `403` (forbidden) errors once the website detects that you’re a bot. See the web scraping lecture note and these links ([link1](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/practices.html#avoiding-getting-banned), [link2](https://scrapeops.io/python-scrapy-playbook/scrapy-403-unhandled-forbidden-error/), [link3](https://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/403-forbidden-error-web-scraping/), [link4](https://scrapingrobot.com/blog/most-common-user-agents/)) for how to work around that issue. Adding a delay for each page and changing user agent will often be most helpful!\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep an eye out for `403` error you see! Make sure to examine the `status_code` attribute of the returned value from `requests.get()`. You want your status to be `200` (meaning OK). Print something if you see `403` (or raise an `Exception` if you are familiar with it).\n",
    "If they know that you are on Python or if you are requesting pages without much delays, they will certainly try to block you. One way to change user agent on your code is presented in the lecture note. For the autograder to finish in reasonable time, please do not put the delays longer than two seconds between requests."

    "### 2. Write Your Scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will write a web scraper for a movie of your choice by giving its subdirectory on TMDB website as an argument. We will implement two parsing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- `parse(suffix)` should assume that you start on a movie page, and then navigate to the *Full Cast & Crew* page. Remember that this page has url `<movie_url>cast`. (You are allowed to hardcode that part.) Once there, the `parse_full_credits(suffix)` should be called. The `parse()` function does not return any data. This function should be no more than 5 lines of code, excluding comments and docstrings. Example: `parse(\"671-harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone\")`.-->\n",
    "- `parse_full_credits(movie_directory)` should assume that you start on the *Full Cast & Crew* page with the url `https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/<movie_directory>/cast`. Its purpose is to call the function `parse_actor_page(df, actor_directory)` for the page of each actor listed on the page. Crew members are not included (consider using `not` command in CSS selector). Initialize an empty `DataFrame` with two columns `actor` and `movie_or_TV_name`, then call the function `parse_actor_page` for each actor. The `parse_full_credits()` function returns the fully loaded `df`, with actor names and movie titles each actor worked on. The `DataFrame` should not have duplicate entries, and it should be sorted by actor name as the primary key, then movie titles. Try to avoid visiting the same page multiple times. This function should be no more than 10 lines of code, excluding comments and docstrings. \n",
    "  - Example: `df = parse_full_credits(\"671-harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone\")`\n",
    "- `parse_actor_page(df, actor_directory)` should assume that you start on the page of an actor. For each movie with the \"Acting\" role, you will add a row to the `DataFrame` `df` with two columns, `actor` and `movie_or_TV_name`. Please only include the works listed in \"Acting\" section of the actor page. Keep in mind that \"Acting\" might not be on the top of their lists; for example, [David Holmes](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/1796507-david-holmes) is credited with an acting role in HP1, but spent most of his career as a stunt double of Daniel Radcliffe (as a part of Crew). On his page, you will see \"Crew\" before \"Acting\". \n",
    "Note that you will need to determine both the name of the actor and the name of each movie or TV show through parsing the HTML page. This function should be no more than 20 lines of code, excluding comments and docstrings. It should return the `DataFrame` `df` with all the works of the actor added at the end of `df`. \n",
    "  - Example: `df_updated = parse_actor_page(df, \"10980-daniel-radcliffe\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided that these functions are correctly implemented, you can run the code \n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = parse_full_credits(\"671-harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "to create a `DataFrame` with a column for actors and another for movies or TV shows for _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_. You might want to save the result as a `.csv` file before proceeding to the next part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your functions; make sure to check the following: \n",
    "- `parse_actor_page()`\n",
    "  - only parses all the works under the \"Acting\" section\n",
    "  - even if \"Acting\" is not on the top of the lists\n",
    "  - remove duplicate work names within each actor (added 5/23)\n",
    "- `parse_full_credits()` \n",
    "  - is parsing all the actors,\n",
    "  - is not parsing crew members,\n",
    "  - does not parse duplicate pages, and\n",
    "  - of course, if the results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge\n",
    "If you’re looking for a challenge, think about ways that may make your recommendations more accurate. Consider scraping the number of episodes as well or limiting the number of actors you get per show to make sure you only get the main series cast. If you do so, please use separate function names."

    "### ANSWER\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preface \n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for web scrapping and recommending movies uses the following fucntions: `parse_actor_page`, `parse_full_credits`, and `plot_cast_movies`. The `parse_actor_page` `parse_full_credits` are located in `hw5module.py` and were imported from the `hw5module.py` ([file](./hw5module.py)) located in the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Use web scraping to extract cast members from a TMDB movie link supplied by a user. Recommend movies or TV shows that credit the most actors from the original movie link.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Investigate TMDB Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The TMDB structure was investigated by navigating potential paths that the webscrapper would take. The paths to cast member credited movies are shown below. In addition, to documenting paths, SelectorGadget was used to select and filter css elements to later be used to extract links and information form the pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Possible Paths to cast member credited movies:\n",
    "1) [Movie Profile] => [Movie Cast] => [Cast Profile] = [Cast Member credited Movies]\n",
    "2)                    [Movie Cast] => [Cast Profile] = [Cast Member credited Movies]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Link Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Before connecting to the TMDB movie link, The function `parse_full_credits` checked the link using conditionals. If the link was not a TMDB movie link then an error would be raised. If the link was a movie link, but it was not the cast link, `/cast` was appended to the link before requesting. [Unit Test 6](#Unit-Test-6) tested the error catch for movies that are not a TMDB movie link and successfully raised an error. From [Unit Test 5](#Unit-Test-5), if a bad TMDB movie link is supplied, TMDB does not raise a 403 error; therefore, to raise an error to the user, webscrapping was used to check if one of the website headings told the user if there was an error (See Webscraping Below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Snippets of `parse_full_credits` that error catch links provided:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if link is a TMDB movie link, otherwise raise an error\n",
    "if not movie_directory.startswith(\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/\"):\n",
    "        raise Exception(\"Not a TMDB movie. Enter a new cast link.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if TMDB movie link is a cast list, otherwise make it a cast list:\n",
    "if not movie_directory.endswith(\"/cast\"):\n",
    "    movie_directory = f\"{movie_directory}/cast\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Use BeautifulSoup and Webscraping to check if not a TMDB movie and raise error:\n",
    "if soup.select('h2')[0].text == \"Oops! We can't find the page you're looking for\":\n",
    "        raise Exception(\"Bad TMDB movie Link\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Request to get the Website's HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "The `parse_actor_page` and `parse_full_credits` functions used the python library, `requests`, to get the html code from TMDB for webscraping. If the link is a valid TMDB link, a request will be made to the website a request will get the html code. A request that is successfull will have a status code equal to 200. If the connection was unsuccessfull or TBMD assumes you are a bot, then the status code will be 403. If the status code is 403 `parse_actor_page` and `parse_full_credits` will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Snippets used in `parse_actor_page` and `parse_full_credits` that error catch a status code 403:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Start new session/browser\n",
    "s = requests.session()\n",
    "# Randomly select a valid User Agent from a list of user agents\n",
    "headers = {'User-Agent': random.choice(user_agents)}\n",
    "# Get HTML from link as a the user agent\n",
    "response = s.get(link, headers=headers)\n",
    "# if request.response status code is 403 then raise error:\n",
    "if response.status_code == 403:\n",
    "    raise Exception(\"403 Error. Check link, internet, and bot status.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Denfense Against Bot Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "__Random User Agents__\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to evade bot detection is to change the user information that is presented to TMDB. This makes TMDB think that a new user is accessing the website from the same IP address. A list of new valid user agents was aquired from a [github post](https://gist.github.com/pzb/b4b6f57144aea7827ae4). For `parse_actor_page` and `parse_full_credits` a new session was created with a random user agent from a list of valid user agents. This simulates a new user opening up a new browser. After requesting the page. the session was closed to avoid too many sessions being open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a similulated User Agent:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Clearing Cache__\n",
    "\n",
    "Cache can be used by TMDB to track former visits to TMDB; therefore after requesting each session, the sessions cache was cleared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Snippets used in `parse_actor_page` and `parse_full_credits` that clear cache:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Snippets used in `parse_actor_page` and `parse_full_credits` that simulate new browsers, randomize User Agents, clear cache and close session:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Start new session/browser\n",
    "s = requests.session()\n",
    "# Randomly select a valid User Agent from a list of user agents\n",
    "headers = {'User-Agent': random.choice(user_agents)}\n",
    "# Get HTML from link as a the user agent\n",
    "response = s.get(link, headers=headers)\n",
    "# Clear cookies after accessing HTML data\n",
    "s.cookies.clear() \n",
    "...\n",
    "# Close session/browser\n",
    "s.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Random Delay between requests__\n",
    "\n",
    "Periodic and quick requests to TMDB can be a sign that you are a bot. To give the presense as a user, a random integer was generated to be supplied to a sleep function. This serviced as a random delay between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "time.sleep(random.randint(1, 3))\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### WebScraping\n",
    "\n",
    "__parse_full_credits:__\n",
    "\n",
    "`Requests` and  `BeautifulSoup` were used to get the html data and select the css elements provided by using   `SelectorGadget`. The text was selected from the css element giving a list of texts that were in the css element. This was perfomed in the `parse_actor_page` and `parse_full_credits` fucntions. The goal of the `parse_full_credits` is to extract actor profile links from a movie cast list. `SelectorGadget` was used to exclude crewmembers who are not actors. The extracted links were not full links, they were child links within the TMDB actor parent domain. Therefore, the parent domain was added as a prefix to the link. The link now directed the bot to the actor's profile, but there was information that we didnt want to include like awards. To solve this issue, a filter was appended as a suffix to the url which used TMDB's built in filtering function. This was done for all actors in the original movie cast and were recorded in a list.The list was used to loop through all actor profile links using a for loop. For each loop, `parse_actor_page` was called where a actors link and an dataframe were supplied. \n",
