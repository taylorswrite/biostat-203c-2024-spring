    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will create a simple webapp using Dash by Plotly and describe how you did it. The skills you will need are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dash fundamentals, including callbacks.\n",
    "2. Database skills, including adding items to databases and displaying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "__You are not required to deploy your app__ to the internet, although you are certainly welcome to do so if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The app you’re going to build is a simple message bank. It should do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Allow the user to __submit__ messages to the bank.\n",
    "2. Allow the user to __view__ a sample of the messages currently stored in the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you should style your app to look attractive and interesting! I encourage you to get creative on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Jupyter Notebook will contain all the code for the app so that when it is exported as a `.py` file, it can run a webapp with the command `python hw6.py`. It should also contain several screencaps from the functioning of your app, as well as a discussion of the Python functions you implemented to create your app. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to (and indeed encouraged) build on any of the examples from class, as well as any other resources you are able to find. The lecture materials are good starting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The code for your app must be hosted in a private GitHub repository.__ I suggest you begin by creating such a repository. Commit and push each time you successfully add a new piece of functionality or resolve a bug. __You may be asked to make it public after June 9th, 8:30 am for peer review__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "### 1. Enable Submissions\n",
    "First, create a `submit` functionality in `app.py` with three user interface elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A text box for submitting a message.\n",
    "2. A text box for submitting the name of the user.\n",
    "3. A \"submit\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, write two Python functions for database management in the file `app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_message_db()` should handle creating the database of messages.\n",
    "  1. Check whether there is a database called `message_db` defined in the global scope. If not, then connect to that database and assign it to the global variable `message_db`. To do this last step, write a line like `message_db = sqlite3.connect(\"messages_db.sqlite\")`\n",
    "  2. Check whether a table called `messages` exists in `message_db`, and create it if not. For this purpose, the SQL command `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is helpful. Give the table a `handle` column (text) and a `message` column (text).\n",
    "  3. Return the connection `message_db`.\n",
    "  4. Here is a helpful starter code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message_db = None\n",
    "def get_message_db():\n",
    "    # write some helpful comments here\n",
    "    global message_db\n",
    "    if message_db:\n",
    "        return message_db\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        message_db = sqlite3.connect(\"messages_db.sqlite\", check_same_thread=False)\n",
    "        cmd = '' # replace this with your SQL query\n",
    "        cursor = message_db.cursor()\n",
    "        cursor.execute(cmd)\n",
    "        return message_db\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function `insert_message(handle, message)` should handle inserting a user message into the database of messages.\n",
    "  1. Using a cursor, insert the message into the `message` database. Remember that you’ll need to provide the handle and the message itself. You’ll need to write a SQL command to perform the insertion.\n",
    "    - __Note__: when working directly with SQL commands, it is necessary to run `db.commit()` after inserting a row into `db` in order to ensure that your row insertion has been saved.\n",
    "    - A column called `rowid` is automatically generated by default. It gives an integer index to each row you add to the database.\n",
    "    - Close the database connection within the function!\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Finally, write a callback function `submit()` to update the components. Maybe it would be nice to add a small note thanking the user for their submission and print an error message if it failed.\n",
    "  1. Extract the `handle` and the `message` from the components. You’ll need to ensure that your callback deals with the user input by appropriately specifying the property of the input elements. \n",
    "  2. You might want to use the keyword argment `prevent_initial_call`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Viewing Random Submissions\n",
    "Write a function called `random_messages(n)`, which will return a collection of `n` random messages from the `message_db`, or fewer if necessary. This [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2279706/select-random-row-from-a-sqlite-table) might help. Don’t forget to close the database connection within the function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, write a new component to display the messages extracted from `random_messages()`. Once again, here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, write a callback function `view()` to display random messages. This function should first call `random_messages()` to grab some random messages (I chose a cap of 5), and then display these messages using a loop. It should be triggered when the \"update\" button is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Customize Your App\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's customize this app by changing styles! At least, you should\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporate a non-default font.\n",
    "- Use color in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to add CSS or other stylesheets in order to give your app a personal feel. Extra credits may be given for a more sophiscated and appealing visual. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your app should be a lot more colorful than the screencaps shown in this notebook!!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "For your notebook, write a tutorial describing how you constructed your webpage. You should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separate code blocks and explanations for each of the Python functions you used to build your app (there should be at least five of them).\n",
    "- Display your app running within the notebook.  \n",
    "- Your report must include two screencaps:\n",
    "  - In the first screencap, you should show an example of a user submitting a message. In the handle field, __please use either your name or your GitHub handle__.\n",
    "  - In the second screencap, you should show an example of a user viewing submitted messages. Show at least two messages, one of which is the message you submitted in the previous screencap. __This message should show your name or GitHub handle__.\n",
    "Additionally, please include in your report a link to the GitHub repository containing the code for your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "0. There is no autograder for this homework. \n",
    "  - For `code` section, please submit the `zip` file containing all the files in your GitHub repository.  \n",
    "    - This should at least include `hw6.ipynb`, `hw6.py` (the python file converted from this notebook), and the two screencaps. \n",
    "    - If you used any other file (e.g., image or css style file), please also include them.\n",
    "  - For the `pdf` section, the URL to your GitHub repo for this homework must appear.\n",
    "  - __You may be asked to send in the URL to your GitHub repo before the final Sunday class and make the repo public during the class. This homework may involve peer review grading.__ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Problem\n",
    "1. Each of the required functions is implemented in a logical way.\n",
    "2. Each of the required functions appears to successfully achieve the required task.\n",
    "3. Callback functions also include the appropriate additional functions. For example, the callback function `view()` should call `random_messages()`.\n",
    "4. Some styling should be done; it should be different from what is shown in the class. You should change font and color to be used. Extra credits for a more sophiscasted and visually appealing approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Style and Documentation\n",
    "5. Helpful comments are supplied throughout the code. __Docstrings are not required in this homework, and you don't need to show the testing of `get_message_db()`, `insert_message()`, and `random_messages()` outside the web app as well.__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing\n",
    "6. The overall report is written in engaging and unambiguous English prose. There is written explanations throughout the post, such that a student with the knowledge of the first five weeks of this course could learn to perform the demonstrated tasks by reading the post.\n",
    "7. Each block of code has a clearly explained purpose.\n",
    "8. The notebook is organized into clearly delimited sections using markdown headers (#), making it easier for the reader to navigate.\n",
    "9. The notebook includes the two required screencaps demonstrating the submission and viewing pages of the app.\n",
    "10. The notebook includes a discussion of all Python functions used to create the app. This should include, at minimum, `get_message_db()`, `insert_message()`, `random_messages()`, `submit()`, and `view()`.\n",
    "11. The notebook launches the app inside it.\n",
    "12. The notebook includes a link to the GitHub repository containing the code for the app.\n"

    "For organizational purposes, as well as ease of reading, the UI elements were defined outside of the UI layout. This was done so that it would be easier to see and modify the UI layout as well as make changes to any UI element. There were two types of UI elements that were used. There was HTML elements and bootstrap style sheet elements. The HTML elements were used to create titles/headers for the app as well as its main components and the all messages box. The bootstrap stylesheet elements were used to make the interactive and stylized user input elements. Some examples of both are showing below. in the next section, these elements will be added to the app inside of the UI layout. The most important parts of a UI input element is its ID, placeholder value, status, and appearance. The ID is important because it is used to be reference the UI element in function callbacks in the server, back-end of the app. The ID allows for the callback to get the input, output, or status of a UI element and use it within the function. For the HTML UI elements, the appearance was modified using CSS. \n",

    "### Define UI Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining the layout of the app sounds like a daunting task, but it is relatively easy compared to defining the UI elements. The UI layout is one of the most important parts of a dash app. For any UI element to appear in the final production, it must appear in the UI layout section. The layout section is powerful, for example by using nested rows and columns, UI elements were easily aligned and grouped together and if further stylization was needed, CSS could be used to alter the appearance. This section could look like a jumbled mess, but additional steps were taken to make sure that the layout section was readable by defining all UI elements outside of the UI layout.\n",

    "### Server Callback Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Server callback functions are needed in order to make the app perform actions. Without server callback functions, when a button is pushed or text is entered into an input field, nothing will happen. additionally, without server callbacks, the functions we defined above in the database functions section can't be called by clicking a submit button, can't take inputs from fields in the app, and can't output to the app. callbacks are essential for the app to be interactive. There are three main components in a callback, an input, output, and state. Callbacks use the UI element ID to link the inputs and outputs to a function to the UI element of the app. An input acts like a trigger where it can be used to function. An output takes the return value of a function and send it to the UI element based on its ID. The state is used to get the value of a UI element, but not use it as a trigger to call the function. there are too many server callback functions to talk about in this summary therefore, the two main callback functions will be covered, the `submit` and `view` callback functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `submit` Callback Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `submit` function is special because  the callback it has two outputs, one input, and two states. The two outputs are used to notify the user if a message was sent or if the user has not inputted enough information. The input and trigger is the submit button where when the submit button is clicked, the function is triggered. The two states are the username/handle and the user message inputs. The username/handle and the user message are inputted into the `insert_message` function which was defined above. This inserts, the values into the SQL table. If a username/handle or  message is empty, a lack of username/handle or message notification will be sent to the user, otherwise a successful sent message notification will be sent. There are two outputs so two boolean values are returned to trigger the notifications. Additionally, to prevent an initial call option is set to true so that the callback function is not triggered upon app start up.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### `View` Callback Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `view` callback function has two outputs and one input. One output is all of the random messages selected and the second output is the updated notification sent to the user. The input and trigger is when the update button is pressed when the update button is pressed, the callback function `view` is called. When it's called, a list of messages from `random_messages` is used to append all HTML text elements. This is returned and sent to the HTML text box with the ID all_messages. A true statement is used to send the user a notification that the messages have been updated.\n",
