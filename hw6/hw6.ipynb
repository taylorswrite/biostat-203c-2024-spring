    "Allow the user to submit messages to the bank.\n",
    "Allow the user to view a sample of the messages currently stored in the bank.# Homework 6: Web Development\n",
    "\n",
    "__Due: Friday, June 7th, 8:30 AM, late submissions accepted without penalties until Sunday, June 9th, 8:30 AM.__ This may be extended if the situation allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will create a simple webapp using Dash by Plotly and describe how you did it. The skills you will need are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dash fundamentals, including callbacks.\n",
    "2. Database skills, including adding items to databases and displaying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "__You are not required to deploy your app__ to the internet, although you are certainly welcome to do so if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The app you’re going to build is a simple message bank. It should do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Allow the user to __submit__ messages to the bank.\n",
    "2. Allow the user to __view__ a sample of the messages currently stored in the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you should style your app to look attractive and interesting! I encourage you to get creative on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Jupyter Notebook will contain all the code for the app so that when it is exported as a `.py` file, it can run a webapp with the command `python hw6.py`. It should also contain several screencaps from the functioning of your app, as well as a discussion of the Python functions you implemented to create your app. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to (and indeed encouraged) build on any of the examples from class, as well as any other resources you are able to find. The lecture materials are good starting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The code for your app must be hosted in a private GitHub repository.__ I suggest you begin by creating such a repository. Commit and push each time you successfully add a new piece of functionality or resolve a bug. __You may be asked to make it public after June 9th, 8:30 am for peer review__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "### 1. Enable Submissions\n",
    "First, create a `submit` functionality in `app.py` with three user interface elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A text box for submitting a message.\n",
    "2. A text box for submitting the name of the user.\n",
    "3. A \"submit\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, write two Python functions for database management in the file `app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_message_db()` should handle creating the database of messages.\n",
    "  1. Check whether there is a database called `message_db` defined in the global scope. If not, then connect to that database and assign it to the global variable `message_db`. To do this last step, write a line like `message_db = sqlite3.connect(\"messages_db.sqlite\")`\n",
    "  2. Check whether a table called `messages` exists in `message_db`, and create it if not. For this purpose, the SQL command `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is helpful. Give the table a `handle` column (text) and a `message` column (text).\n",
    "  3. Return the connection `message_db`.\n",
    "  4. Here is a helpful starter code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message_db = None\n",
    "def get_message_db():\n",
    "    # write some helpful comments here\n",
    "    global message_db\n",
    "    if message_db:\n",
    "        return message_db\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        message_db = sqlite3.connect(\"messages_db.sqlite\", check_same_thread=False)\n",
    "        cmd = '' # replace this with your SQL query\n",
    "        cursor = message_db.cursor()\n",
    "        cursor.execute(cmd)\n",
    "        return message_db\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function `insert_message(handle, message)` should handle inserting a user message into the database of messages.\n",
    "  1. Using a cursor, insert the message into the `message` database. Remember that you’ll need to provide the handle and the message itself. You’ll need to write a SQL command to perform the insertion.\n",
    "    - __Note__: when working directly with SQL commands, it is necessary to run `db.commit()` after inserting a row into `db` in order to ensure that your row insertion has been saved.\n",
    "    - A column called `rowid` is automatically generated by default. It gives an integer index to each row you add to the database.\n",
    "    - Close the database connection within the function!\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Finally, write a callback function `submit()` to update the components. Maybe it would be nice to add a small note thanking the user for their submission and print an error message if it failed.\n",
    "  1. Extract the `handle` and the `message` from the components. You’ll need to ensure that your callback deals with the user input by appropriately specifying the property of the input elements. \n",
    "  2. You might want to use the keyword argment `prevent_initial_call`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Viewing Random Submissions\n",
    "Write a function called `random_messages(n)`, which will return a collection of `n` random messages from the `message_db`, or fewer if necessary. This [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2279706/select-random-row-from-a-sqlite-table) might help. Don’t forget to close the database connection within the function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, write a new component to display the messages extracted from `random_messages()`. Once again, here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, write a callback function `view()` to display random messages. This function should first call `random_messages()` to grab some random messages (I chose a cap of 5), and then display these messages using a loop. It should be triggered when the \"update\" button is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Customize Your App\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of the app so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"HW6.png\" alt=\"app example\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's customize this app by changing styles! At least, you should\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporate a non-default font.\n",
    "- Use color in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to add CSS or other stylesheets in order to give your app a personal feel. Extra credits may be given for a more sophiscated and appealing visual. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your app should be a lot more colorful than the screencaps shown in this notebook!!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "For your notebook, write a tutorial describing how you constructed your webpage. You should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separate code blocks and explanations for each of the Python functions you used to build your app (there should be at least five of them).\n",
    "- Display your app running within the notebook.  \n",
    "- Your report must include two screencaps:\n",
    "  - In the first screencap, you should show an example of a user submitting a message. In the handle field, __please use either your name or your GitHub handle__.\n",
    "  - In the second screencap, you should show an example of a user viewing submitted messages. Show at least two messages, one of which is the message you submitted in the previous screencap. __This message should show your name or GitHub handle__.\n",
    "Additionally, please include in your report a link to the GitHub repository containing the code for your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "0. There is no autograder for this homework. \n",
    "  - For `code` section, please submit the `zip` file containing all the files in your GitHub repository.  \n",
    "    - This should at least include `hw6.ipynb`, `hw6.py` (the python file converted from this notebook), and the two screencaps. \n",
    "    - If you used any other file (e.g., image or css style file), please also include them.\n",
    "  - For the `pdf` section, the URL to your GitHub repo for this homework must appear.\n",
    "  - __You may be asked to send in the URL to your GitHub repo before the final Sunday class and make the repo public during the class. This homework may involve peer review grading.__ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Problem\n",
    "1. Each of the required functions is implemented in a logical way.\n",
    "2. Each of the required functions appears to successfully achieve the required task.\n",
    "3. Callback functions also include the appropriate additional functions. For example, the callback function `view()` should call `random_messages()`.\n",
    "4. Some styling should be done; it should be different from what is shown in the class. You should change font and color to be used. Extra credits for a more sophiscasted and visually appealing approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Style and Documentation\n",
    "5. Helpful comments are supplied throughout the code. __Docstrings are not required in this homework, and you don't need to show the testing of `get_message_db()`, `insert_message()`, and `random_messages()` outside the web app as well.__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing\n",
    "6. The overall report is written in engaging and unambiguous English prose. There is written explanations throughout the post, such that a student with the knowledge of the first five weeks of this course could learn to perform the demonstrated tasks by reading the post.\n",
    "7. Each block of code has a clearly explained purpose.\n",
    "8. The notebook is organized into clearly delimited sections using markdown headers (#), making it easier for the reader to navigate.\n",
    "9. The notebook includes the two required screencaps demonstrating the submission and viewing pages of the app.\n",
    "10. The notebook includes a discussion of all Python functions used to create the app. This should include, at minimum, `get_message_db()`, `insert_message()`, `random_messages()`, `submit()`, and `view()`.\n",
    "11. The notebook launches the app inside it.\n",
    "12. The notebook includes a link to the GitHub repository containing the code for the app.\n"
