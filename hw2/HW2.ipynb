For example, there's been a lot of buzz about the new [GPT-3 model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), related to its [carbon footprint](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/06/17/deep-learnings-climate-change-problem/#2781c1b16b43), [bigoted tendencies](https://medium.com/fair-bytes/how-biased-is-gpt-3-5b2b91f1177), and, yes, impressive (and often [humorous](https://aiweirdness.com/)) [ability to replicate human-like text in response to prompts.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/) \n",

    "1. Look at the most recent `n` characters in our generated text. Say that `n = 3` and the 3 most recent character are `the`. \n",

    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "options = [\"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\"]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "['One'] # output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and second arguments must be lists of equal length. Note also that the return value is a list -- if you want the value *in* the list, you need to get it out via indexing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***Note***: For grading purposes, the `options` should be the possible `n+1`-grams in the order of first appeareance in the text. If you are working through the strings from beginning to end, you will not have issues with this, as dictionary keys are ordered. Please do NOT use [`random.seed()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_random_seed.asp) in your function -- the autograder code will do it. You are welcome to try it out in your notebook for reproducible results if you are interested. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint***: The first thing your function should do is call `count_ngrams` above to generate the required dictionary. Then, handle the logic described above in the main loop."
