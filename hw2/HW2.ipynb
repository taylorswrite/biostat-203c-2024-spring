    "Many of you may have encountered the output of machine learning models which, when \"seeded\" with a small amount of text, produce a larger corpus of text which is expected to be similar or relevant to the seed text. For example, there's been a lot of buzz about the new [GPT-3 model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), related to its [carbon footprint](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/06/17/deep-learnings-climate-change-problem/#2781c1b16b43), [bigoted tendencies](https://medium.com/fair-bytes/how-biased-is-gpt-3-5b2b91f1177), and, yes, impressive (and often [humorous](https://aiweirdness.com/)) [ability to replicate human-like text in response to prompts.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/) \n",

    "We are not going to program a complicated deep learning model, but we will construct a much simpler language model that performs a similar task. Using tools like iteration and dictionaries, we will create a family of **Markov language models** for generating text. For the purposes of this assignment, an $n$-th order Markov model is a function that constructs a string of text one letter at a time, using only knowledge of the most recent $n$ letters. You can think of it as a writer with a \"memory\" of $n$ letters. \n"

    "\n",
    "1. Look at the most recent `n` characters in our generated text. Say that `n = 3` and the 3 most recent character are `the`. \n",

    "For example, if there are 3 occurrences of `them`, 4 occurrences of `the `, and 1 occurrences of `thei` in the n-gram dictionary, then our next character is `m` with probabiliy 3/8, `[space]` with probability 1/2, and `i` with probability `1/8`. \n",

    "## Notes and Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint***: A good function for performing the random choice is the `choices()` function in the `random` module. You can use it like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "options = [\"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\"]\n",
    "weights = [1, 2, 3] # \"Two\" is twice as likely as \"One\", \"Three\" three times as likely. \n",
    "\n",
    "random.choices(options, weights) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "['One'] # output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and second arguments must be lists of equal length. Note also that the return value is a list -- if you want the value *in* the list, you need to get it out via indexing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***Note***: For grading purposes, the `options` should be the possible `n+1`-grams in the order of first appeareance in the text. If you are working through the strings from beginning to end, you will not have issues with this, as dictionary keys are ordered. Please do NOT use [`random.seed()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_random_seed.asp) in your function -- the autograder code will do it. You are welcome to try it out in your notebook for reproducible results if you are interested. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint***: The first thing your function should do is call `count_ngrams` above to generate the required dictionary. Then, handle the logic described above in the main loop."
